Example of output for Q2 with synchronization:
Starting kitchen work ...
The stock input contains 0 food.
The stock output contains 100000000 food.
Thread : main : The stock input contains 0 food.
... done (9.303 second(s))

Example of output for Q2 without synchronization:
Starting kitchen work ...
The stock input contains 48105788 food.
The stock output contains 51444067 food.
Thread : main : The stock input contains 48105788 food.
... done (0.153 second(s))

We observe that two threads accelerate the process time of the food, but we notice huge inconsistencies in the results.
This can be explained by the concurrency problem (Multiple processes or threads access and modify shared resources
simultaneously, which may lead to deadlocks, resource starvation or race conditions). We can correct this problem by
using the keyword in Java "synchronized" in the method signature of put() and get().
