We notice that it doesn't work if we use notify() because it certainly creates deadlocks (the program doesn't end).
The method notify() arbitrary chose a thread to release but it may not be the one that makes the program continue.
Replacing notify() by notifyAll() allows every thread to be released, guaranteeing no deadlocks in the process.

Example of output for Q7 with notifyAll() :
Starting kitchen work ...
... done (0.069 second(s))
A contains 0 food
C contains 0 food
B contains 10000 food

The program is way faster than the other.
